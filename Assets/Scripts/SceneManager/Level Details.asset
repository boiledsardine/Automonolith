  levelDetails:
  - levelName: Basic Controls
    levelDesc: This is a tutorial for basic controls in Automonolith - camera controls
      and the buttons you'll be pressing for the game.
  - levelName: Using Methods
    levelDesc: 'Now that you''re somewhat used to controlling your interface, how
      about we learn how to use methids to give G4wain some commands?


      -Morgan'
  - levelName: Level 1
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by moving pillars out of the way.
  - levelName: Level 2
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Integer Invocation
    levelDesc: 'Now that you''ve gotten your mitts on a memory module, how about
      we actually use it? I''ll teach you to use variables and how data types work.
      Well, mostly integers. And some math.


      -Morgan'
  - levelName: String Incantation
    levelDesc: 'Ints are one thing, but I did say there''s other data types. Let''s
      do strings now, yeah? Ints and strings... these are what we''re using in the
      monolith.


      -Morgan'
  - levelName: Level 3
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Level 4
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Nimue's Trial I
    levelDesc: 'I have noticed your traversal of this monument to the Asarel. I,
      Nimue, guardian spirit of this place shall test your ability to command your
      automaton and control its memory.


      -Nimue'
  - levelName: True or False?
    levelDesc: 'Remember when we talked about data types? Yeah, we''ll be tackling
      another one. Trust me, this one''s important to these next few floors. Especially
      since it helps G4wain make decisions.


      -Morgan'
  - levelName: Rite of Repetition
    levelDesc: 'Floors will get a bit more complex from now on. And repetitive. Here
      we''ll tackle loops - code that repeats code! This one might be a bit tricky
      though, so just bear with me for a while.


      -Morgan'
  - levelName: Level 5
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Level 6
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Calling Shots
    levelDesc: 'This floor''s bound to be full of unknowns. So how about we talk
      about making decisions with the if, else-if, and else statements? Conditional
      statements, the cornerstone of decision-making in programs.


      -Morgan'
  - levelName: Level 7
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Level 8
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Nimue's Trial II
    levelDesc: 'You have done well to make it this far. But unless you prove to me
      your grasp of looping and decision-making, I cannot allow your further passage.
      So prove yourself to me, Arthur of Calot.


      -Nimue'
  - levelName: Box of Stuff
    levelDesc: 'Hey, G4wain''s memory module got upgraded! Now he can use arrays.
      What are arrays, you ask? Basically a collection of values in a single variable.
      We''ll do some really basic stuff with them here.


      -Morgan'
  - levelName: Level 9
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Level 10
    levelDesc: Reach the exit totem by getting the key and opening the gate blocking
      it.
  - levelName: Nimue's Trial III
    levelDesc: 'Your efforts are impressive, Arthur of Calot. It has been ages since
      one has reached these chambers. Come, then, and I shall appraise your understanding
      of arrays.


      -Nimue'
