    - You've demonstrated familiarity with Akashic artifacts that haven't been studied
      in-depth by the Great Scholars, even those that have only been recently discovered
      by this expedition.
    - You've been right about them so far, and yet, I couldn't find a scrap of lore
      about any of these devices in the fragmented records of Akashic history or
      the Grand Library.
    - I doubt you're guessing either, given that you've been 100% correct so far.

    - Reason I know so much about the Monolith? I watched as it was being built,
      after all. And to answer a past question of yours about why I shut up around
      NImue? Her and I go way back.

      for now and we continue this expedition?
