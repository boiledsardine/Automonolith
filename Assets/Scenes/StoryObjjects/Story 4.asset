    - That word more accurately translates to "overseer", actually. A guardian AI
      the Akasha employed in their grander builds, like the Monolith.
    - Designed to oversee all maintenance and defensive functions, as well as assist
      Akashic residents and curate their works when necessary.

    - I see. Which means this golem was more a servitor than a defender unit. And
      here I'd hoped I'd see footage of the War of Enclaves, or of the Akashic civilization
      at its peak.

    - You've barely scratched the surface of the monolith, so plenty of discoveries
      left to be made. WIth any luck, we wouldn't run into the Nimue system any time
