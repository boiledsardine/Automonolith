    - So, this is the Automonolith, hm? All the texts and treatises written about
      it... I'd have thought it would be... grander.

    - It's old. Ancient, even. Without its caretakers, time would've been free to
      ravage it. And time has not been kind to it at all.
    - It's supposed to be more impressive on the inside. A marvel of Akashic engineering,
      with systems meant to outlast their civilization... who knows what secrets
      are waiting inside?

    - But it would be great if the rumors were true... that the ancient Akasha figured
      out a way to extend one's lifespan. Hopefully there's a lead to that rumor
      somewhere in here.
    - Anyway, adventurer groups and scholars couldn't get too far in, not without
      the Monolith's automatic defenses activating and disposing of the intruders.

    - Yes, G4wain. Its core was originally from a servitor golem found in the Monolith's
      lower floors.
    - It took a while to figure out how to make it serve my needs, but with this,
      hopefully the Monolith will treat G4wain as one of its own.

      ancient weapon. Now, ready to get started?
