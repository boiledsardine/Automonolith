    - Looks like that servitor core you found did the trick after all. The Monolith
      didn't react to G4wain the same way it did to the other explorers.

    - This section of the Monolith seems... devoid of technological artefacts I could
      bring back for study. If this is going to be a trend that informs the yield
      of this expedition, then...

      already seen before scattered around.

    - Yes, a tomb and a monument to its inhabitants who fought in one of the Akasha's
      most historic battles. There has to be something in here, something related
      to that event. But so far, nothing.

    - Don't jump to conclusions just yet, look over there. A broken construct, same
      make and model as the one you extracted G4wain's core from.
    - Scrap heap might have some valuable parts in it, maybe we can even upgrade
      G4wain with it.
