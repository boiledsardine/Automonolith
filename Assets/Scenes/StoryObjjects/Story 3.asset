    - Fascinating, this memory module. I don't believe this one has been documented
      before.

    - Running experiments with the memory module we extracted not long ago. I figured
      it had a deeper purpose than simply committing variables into memory for future
      use.
    - If my theory about it is correct, it holds the memories of the machine we took
      it from... memories that reach way back to the time when the Akasha were still
      around and the Monolith was at its heyday.

    - Somewhat. I've figured out how to pull information out of the module that isn't
      related to variables, but I've yet to decipher that information into something
      I can read.

    - Hey, maybe you shouldn't be fiddling with that too much. What happens if you
      accidentally break it?
    - G4wain won't be able to navigate the Monolith anymore, especially the rooms
      that need him to remember things.

    - 'You may have a point. Perhaps I''ll get to work deciphering what I''ve extracted
      from the module. Who knows what secrets of the Akasha it might tell me? '
    - But for now, I need to know more to start that process. We're continuing the
      expedition.
