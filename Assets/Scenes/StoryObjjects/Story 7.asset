    - I'll be fine. After all, I still have that Repetition Engine to study. Interesting
      piece of technology.
    - Shows the efficiency of Akashic constructs with repetitive tasks. No wonder
      their nation used to be a hub for manufacturing back in the day.

      at you now, you look worse than when we started out.

    - Azoth, yes, I've heard of it. I've also heard it could extend one's lifespan
      by a decade or two. But most scholars regard it as myth given the little historical
      support for its existence.

    - Yeah. It's so valuable that it was typically saved for the elites of the Akashic
      civilization. So when the War of Enclaves started and the Akasha's highest
      echelons took the field against each other...
    - Large volumes of it were deployed with the armies. And when it was over and
      a monument to their folly was built where the war ended, it's said that those
      supplies were stored in that tomb as well.
