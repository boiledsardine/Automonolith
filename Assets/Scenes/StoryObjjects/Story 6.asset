      the ones in the lower floors.

    - Yeah, nothing like the servitor models we found earlier. These look like units
      designed for more complex jobs. Bet their cores will have more functions than
      the servitor core G4wain has.

    - I'm betting on that. I've noticed that the monolith's layouts become more complex
      the higher we climb, and that new functions are necessary to continue ascent.
    - If Nimue hadn't given G4wain the Decision Module, I doubt we would've made
      it past the past few floors.

      you to figure out the monolith and Nimue yourself.

    - I meant that as a joke, sorry. I didn't think you'd take it that personally.
      Of course this expedition couldn't have gotten this far without your help.
    - Your help in developing and improving G4wain was essential to our progress.
      Moreso since Lancel0t, Perc1val, and Bor2 failed.

    - Apology accepted, now let's get G4wain's scrappy hands on that broken-down
      robot's scrappy parts.
