    - Yes. Used to be that I was the caretaker of the Monolith, entertaining guests
      and responsible for keeping all the systems running and in check.
    - I used to like the role. But then centuries passed. The Akashic civilization
      collapsed. The Monolith stagnated. Things got boring.
    - 'With nothing else better to do, I installed Nimue, who used to be my assistant,
      as the new Overseer of the place then left. '
    - For centuries more, I wandered... until some punk who needed a familiar caught
      me in a summoning rite.

    - But that's why Nimue said that. We used to be the best of friends, her and
      I. And then I left her alone here.
    - It's fine if she thinks I'm selfish for doing it. But back then, I couldn't
      stand being trapped in a decaying monument to a dead race.
    - Anyway, that's my story. You, on the other hand, have more pressing issues
      at hand.
