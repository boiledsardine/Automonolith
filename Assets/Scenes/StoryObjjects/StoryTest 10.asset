      that burning bridge behind me. I doubt she's willing to forgive me.

    - Awfully pushy, aren't you? Even if I wanted to, forgiveness takes two people.
      Given how rigid Nimue is, she's more likely to want me out of here ASAP than
      give me the time of day.
    - Though it's not like I don't want to make amends. It's just... it's way too
      late for that.

    - Anyway, let's get back to the exploration. The longer we wait, the worse your
      condition gets, after all, and as good as the stuff is, Azoth can't bring back
      the dead.
