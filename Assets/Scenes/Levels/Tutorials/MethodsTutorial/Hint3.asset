    - For this one, move G4wain next to the button on the wall, then turn him so
      he faces it. After that, use "Bot.interact();" to press the button. That should
      open the gate. Then it's just a matter of getting G4wain to the button with
      move methods.
    - 'I''ll give you your first two moves:

      ~Bot.moveUp(2);`

      ~Bot.turnRight();`

      Then
      interact with the wall button and move to the floor button.'
