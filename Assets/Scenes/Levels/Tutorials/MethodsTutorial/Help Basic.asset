    articleText: 'Guide G4wain by writing a short program with code.


      The
      spacebar opens the Code Editor. While it is open, you can type your program
      into it. Press the green Play button in the lower right to start your program.


      Press
      escape to close the Code Editor. The Code Editor will also close once you press
      the Play button.


      Take note that pressing the Play button resets G4wain''s
      position and the level''s state to the beginning, so you have to write code
      that completely lists instructions for G4wain to navigate the level from start
      to finish.'
  - articleName: Basic Syntax
    articleText: 'To get G4wain to do anything, write instructions in the form of
      code.


      Each instruction must be written on its own line, and each line
      must be closed with a semicolon. The semicolon indicates the end of a line
      and instructs G4wain to read the instructions in the next line.


      To
      make G4wain do things, such as move, you have to use methods. Methods are blocks
      of code that perform certain actions. To use methods, you must first specify
      from where those methods are coming from. To access the methods G4wain knows,
      refer to it with "Bot.".


      After writing "Bot.", you can use the methods
      G4wain has access to, such as movement methods. Like so:


      Bot.moveUp();

      Bot.moveRight();'
  - articleName: Methods
    articleText: 'Bot has a set of methods it could perform to navigate the Monolith.
      The Bot class and its methods (moveUp, moveDown(), etc.) are unique to this
      game! You won''t be using them in real code.


      G4wain has the moveUp,
      moveDown, moveLeft, and moveRight methods which you''ll use to instruct G4wain
      to move in a certain direction. To call a method, use that method''s name and
      add "()" at the end.


      For example:


      Bot.moveRight();

      Bot.moveDown();

      Bot.moveLeft();


      The
      code above will make G4wain move right one space, down one space, and left
      one space.'
  - articleName: Arguments
    articleText: 'Arguments are values you pass into methods. Some methods require
      arguments, some don''t, and some can function with or without an argument.


      Arguments
      are written within the () at the end of a method. If a method requires multiple
      arguments, values are separated by a comma.


      For example:

      Bot.moveUp(3);


      This
      will make G4wain move up 3 spaces instead of 1 - and using only one line of
      code instead of the usual three!


      Take note that there are some methods
      that require arguments or else they wouldn''t know what to do.


      For
      example:


      Bot.say("Hello World!") //G4wain will say "Hello World!"

      Bot.say()
      //G4wain won''t know what to say - this is an error!'
