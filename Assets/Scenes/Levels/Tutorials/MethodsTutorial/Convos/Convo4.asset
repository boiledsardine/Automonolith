    - Now, you may have noticed the "()" at the end of methods, right? Usually, people
      put something between parentheses, so the same should apply for code, right?
    - Well, you would be right. Some methods require values called arguments to be
      provided before doing whatever they're meant to do. Kind of like how math questions
      have given values for you to use.
    - Some methods don't need arguments, some need one, some need more than one.
      You can check which arguments a method needs by viewing the tooltips at the
      bottom of the code editor.
    - The methods that do need arguments need certain types of arguments. Some take
      numbers, some take a string of text, we'll get there when we get there.
    - The movement methods you've been using can use arguments or not, and the arguments
      they take are whole numbers. But try using them with arguments to make your
      code more efficient.
    - To pass arguments, simply type the value needed between the parentheses. To
      pass multiple arguments into a method, use a comma to separate them.

    - Typing "Bot.moveUp();" without arguments makes G4wain move up one space...
    - 'So if I type in "Bot.moveUp(5);", G4wain will move five spaces up? And if
      I type in "Bot.moveDown(3);", G4wain will move three spaces down, is that it? '

    - That's precisely it. Why don't you try solving this one in 4 lines of code?
      Bring G4wain over to that button over there and we can move on.
