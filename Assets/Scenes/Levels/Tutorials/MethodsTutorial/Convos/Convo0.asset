    - Now that you've gotten the hang of controlling how you see the Monolith, it's
      time you learn how to actually control G4wain.
    - To do that, you need to use what we call methods. Essentially blocks of code
      that run only when called.
    - There are many methods and you can even make your own, but for now, let's stick
      to ones that G4wain knows.
    - First, you have to call on G4wain to specify that you want to use the methods
      he knows. To do that, type "Bot" and add a "." at the end.
    - This will make sure that G4wain knows you want to access his methods.
    - Next, remember those words at the bottom of the code editor? Those methods
      are what G4wain can use. To use one of those methods, type its name and add
      "()" at the end.
    - 'Take note: you can only write one method per line of code. After you write
      each line of code, close it with a semicolon.'
    - G4wain won't recognize new lines as separate lines. The semicolon tells him
      that he needs to read the next line of code, well, next.
    - Always put a semicolon (;) at the end of your statements! Semicolons denote
      a complete line of code. If you don't, the machine will throw a hissy fit about
      it.

    - So if I want him to move up a space, for example, I type in "Bot.moveUp();"?
      Then he'll do as I command?

    - That's right. Why not try it now? Make G4wain move two spaces up and press
      that button on the floor before we proceed.
    - Type "Bot.moveUp();" twice. You'll notice the word "Bot" become <color=#40c1ac>teal</color>
      when written right and the function name become <color=#cadaa9>pale yellow</color>
      when spelled right.
