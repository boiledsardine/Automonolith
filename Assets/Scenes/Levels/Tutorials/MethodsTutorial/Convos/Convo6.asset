    - G4wain has access to more than just movement methods, you know. You can make
      him turn with the directional "~turnUp()`", "~turnDown()`", "~turnLeft()`",
      and "~turnRight()`" methods.
    - Aside from that, G4wain can also hold on to keys and stone pillars with the
      "~hold()`" and "~drop()`" methods. He can also interact with interactable objects
      like gates and wall buttons with "~interact()`".
    - The "~turn`" methods work well with the "~hold()`", "~drop()`", and "~interact()`"
      methods because G4wain always interacts with whatever he's facing, so you'll
      have to tell him which way to face first.
    - A lot to take in, I know, but these would let G4wain interact with his environment
      in your stead and solve puzzles in the monolith. I've prepared a simple gate
      and button combo here.

    - So I must get G4wain to move next to the button, turn towards it, press it
      with ~interact()`, then move G4wain to the floor button.

    - Right. Don't forget to add "Bot." before the method and a semicolon at the
      end of each line. Now get to it.
