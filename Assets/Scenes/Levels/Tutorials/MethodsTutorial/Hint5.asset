    - So close, and yet so far, huh? For this one, move G4wain next to the yellow
      button on the wall, then turn him so he faces it.
    - After that, use "Bot.interact();" to press the button. That should open the
      gate. Then it's just a matter of getting G4wain next to the exit totem and
      using "Bot.interact();" again.
    - Once he touches the exit totem, we should be good for now.
