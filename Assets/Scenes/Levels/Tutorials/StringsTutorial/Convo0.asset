    - This one will be quick, promise. It's just us tackling a different data type
      for variables.
    - Now, we're dealing with strings. While ints are numbers, strings are text And
      to identify a value as a string, it has to be enclosed by quotation marks (").
    - 'For example:

      string myString0 = "Hello";

      Strings can contain
      many words too:

      string myString1 = "Hello world!";'
    - Why don't you try? Use a string value as an argument to the say() method to
      open that vox gate.
