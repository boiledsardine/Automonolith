    - I just gave him access to a coordinate system and a pathfinding algorithm!
      Now you can tell G4wain which tile to go to instead of outlining his steps
      one by one.
    - Also, this makes use of strings which we just covered. Use the moveTo() command
      and pass a string as an argument. The string should be the coordinates of a
      tile.
    - If all goes right, he'll take the shortest path to a tile.

    - 'Correct. Word of warning though: there''ll still be times where the movement
      methods are better. G4wain isn''t that smart, he''ll walk over a trap if it''s
      the shortest path.'
    - Why don't you try it out? Get to the exit point in 3 or less statements.
