    - This time the array's a bit more hidden, taken only by the ReadStringArr()
      function. Anyway, you have to loop through it to find the right buttons.
    - 'You remember while loops, yeah? Do that, but the condition for the loop should
      have you compare an int with the length of the string. Something like this:'
    - '~int num = 0;`

      ~while(num < arrayName.Length) {`

      ~  // code
      here`

      ~}`'
    - Make sure you're calling the index at the value of the variable, so use arrayName[num].
      If you use a constant value, it'll only read the same index over and over.
