    - This one, I've only declared an array but didn't initialize it. You can edit
      the code so that you assign it an array literal in the first line or you can
      use the new keyword.
    - 'new dataType[array length]

      Where dataType is the type like string or
      int and array length is how many elements you want in that array. Or not if
      you''re using an array literal anyway.'
    - 'You can then attach an array literal after the proper use of the new array
      keywords, like this:

      int[] numArr;

      numArr = new int[] { 3, 4,
      5 };'
    - Try it out. If you get confused, you can check the encyclopedia. It's talked
      about more in-depth there.
