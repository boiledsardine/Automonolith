    - What if you declare an array without assigning it an array literal at the moment
      of declaration? You can't just assign a new value to it easily. You have to
      use the new keyword.
    - 'To use the new keyword to create a new array, use the word "~new`" followed
      by a data type with square braces after it. Like this:'
    - '~int[] numArr; //has no values`

      ~numArr = { 3,4,5 }; //error`

      ~numArr
      = new int[] { 3,4,5 }; //correct - uses the new keyword`'
    - 'That''s just for assigning array literals to a previously-declared but unassigned
      array! There''s other ways to use the new keyword:'
    - 'If you do something like this:

      ~int[] numArrs = new int[3];`

      It''ll
      create an array of 3 elements with default values. Zeroes for ints and blanks
      for strings.'
    - 'If you do something like this:

      ~int[] numArrs = new int[];`

      This
      is an error. New arrays have to have a number between the [] after the data
      type.'
    - 'Alternatively, there''s also this:

      ~int[] numArrs = new int[3] { 1,2,3
      };`

      Make sure your array has a number of elements equal to the number
      inside the ~[]`.'
    - The Monolith won't make you do any of this, but I figured it's good to know
      just in case, you never know.
    - Anyway, for this one, use the new keyword to assign an array literal to that
      unassigned array. Fill it with the strings I provide you. Then use that array
      to get to the exit.
    - As always, check the encyclopedia if you're confused. Good luck!
