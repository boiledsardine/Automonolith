    - Arrays have a Length property that tells you how many elements are in that
      array. You can use the resulting number in a while loop to go through each
      element in order.

    - And because the loop's incrementing the num variable, each time the code repeats
      the say command, the next element in the array is called.
    - 'Get an array''s length by calling its name followed by a dot and then the
      word "Length". Like this:

      int[] numArr = { 1,2,3,4,5 };

      int arrayLength
      = numArr.Length; //this is 5'
    - 'You can use it in a while loop! Just use the length of the array in the loop''s
      condition. Considering the same array from earlier, it goes like this:'
    - 'int num = 0;

      int arrayLength = numArr.Length; //this is 5

      while(num
      < arrayLength) {'
    - "  Bot.say(nums[numArr]); //gets the element of numArr at index num\n  num++;\n}"

    - Yep. Why don't you give it a try? This time, G4wain's got an array from the
      string array panel (the red one). Loop through that array to find all the good
      buttons.
