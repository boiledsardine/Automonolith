    - Arrays have a Length property that tells you how many elements are in that
      array. You can use the resulting number in a while loop to go through each
      element in order.

    - And because the loop's incrementing the num variable, each time the code repeats
      the say command, the next element in the array is called.
    - 'Get an array''s length by calling its name followed by a dot and then the
      word "Length". Like this:

      ~int[] numArr = { 1,2,3,4,5 };`

      ~int
      arrayLength = numArr.Length; //this is 5`'
    - 'You can use it in a while loop! Just use the length of the array in the loop''s
      condition. Considering the same array from earlier, it goes like this:'
    - '~int num = 0;`

      ~while(num < numArr.Length) { //numArr.Length is 5`

      ~ 
      Bot.say(numArr[num]); //gets the element at index num`

      ~  num++;`

    - Yep. Why don't you give it a try? This time, G4wain's got an array from the
      string array panel (the red one). Loop through that array to find all the good
      buttons.
