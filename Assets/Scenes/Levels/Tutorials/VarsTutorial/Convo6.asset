    - Bingo. You can perform math in programming too using arithmetic operators.
      These work on integer values stored inside a variable or not.
    - '"+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, and "/" for
      division. Synatx for a mathematical expression would be just like how you write
      math normally.'

    - Pretty much. Remember to store it in a variable so you can use the result of
      the operation later. Int variables can take mathematical expressions as values.
    - And if you call on it, it'll give you the result of the expression. For example,
      "int num = 5 * 10" - num is equal to 50.
    - You can also pass mathematical expressions as arguments into a method that
      takes numerical values. "Bot.moveUp(3 + 2)" will move G4wain up 5 spaces.

    - Those blue gates are Vox Gates. Unlike mechanical and key gates, they open
      only when the password is spoken.
    - These ones have numbers as their passwords. I know the passwords of course,
      but I figured I'll make you work for it and use the arithmetic operators to
      figure them out.
    - The "Bot.say()" method will make G4wain speak. It takes int and string arguments
      - so both numbers and words. But for now, you'll only be using numbers.
    - Get to it!
