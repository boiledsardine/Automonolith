    - It goes without saying that you can't use a variable that doesn't exist yet.
      It's going to be like trying to remember a memory you don't have.
    - 'So how does one create variables, you ask? It''s called declaration. And it''s
      a rather straightforward process. Use this syntax:

      ~dataType variableName
      = value`'
    - ~dataType` is a data type such as an ~int` (a number) or ~string` (a word),
      ~variableName` is whatever name you want to call the vairable (like x or y),
      and value is the varaible's, well, value.
    - The equals sign means you're trying to assign the value on the right to the
      variable on the left. You'll notice the data type become navy blue in the editor
      when it's spelled correctly.

    - 'Right. Also note that there''s rules to naming variables: it cannot start
      with a number, and it can only have alphanumeric characters and/or underscores.'
    - Just follow those rules for naming variables and you can go crazy with names.
      "xX_MorganRulez_Xz" is valid, "420Arthur" isn't.

    - Right, back to this here stage. Five buttons, four traps. The int (short for
      integer - a numerical value) stored in that green panel on the wall will tell
      you which one is safe.
    - Now get to it!
