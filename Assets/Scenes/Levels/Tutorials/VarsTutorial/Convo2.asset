    - It goes without saying that you can't use a variable that doesn't exist yet.
      It's going to be like trying to remember a memory you don't have.
    - So how does one create variables, you ask? It's called declaration. And it's
      a rather straightforward process.
    - 'Use this syntax:

      type variableName = value'
    - 'type is a data type such as an int (a number) or string (a word),

      variableName
      is whatever name you want to call the vairable (like x or y),'
    - 'and value is the varaible''s, well, value.

      The equals sign means you''re
      trying to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.'

    - 'Right. Also note that there''s rules to naming variables: it cannot start
      with a number, and it can only have alphanumeric characters and/or underscores.'
    - Just follow those rules for naming variables and you can go crazy with names.
      "xX_MorganRulez_Xz" is valid, "420Arthur" isn't.

    - Right, back to this here stage. Five buttons, four traps. The int (short for
      integer - a numerical value) stored in that green panel on the wall will tell
      you which one is safe.
    - Now get to it!
