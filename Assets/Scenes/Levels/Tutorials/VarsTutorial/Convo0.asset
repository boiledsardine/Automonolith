      data types.

    - Variables are for storing data and values. Think of it like a piece of memory
      that's holding a certain number or word at a time.
    - Data types refer to the type a value has. This determines what variables it
      can go into and what operations you can do with it.
    - In programming, numbers and words are not the same and trying to put a word
      where a number should go can cause an error.

    - I see. If I'm getting this right, each variable has a data type which determines
      what I can put in it.

    - 'Right. You''ve been working with one data type so far: integers. Remember
      the numbers you put in the move() functions? Those numbers aren''t variables
      though, since they''re not stored in memory.'
    - Now I get to teach you how variables work, so I set up a spot to learn.
    - See that grid of tiles? The buttons are hiding traps. Only one safe path exists.
      Now because I'm so generous, I'll tell you where to step! But the data you
      seek is stored in these variables three.
    - '"num1", "num2", and "num3". To use the data stored in a variable, you have
      to call it. Use its name where you intend its stored data to go. Like as an
      argument to a method.'

    - So if I want to use the value of "num1" in a moveUp() command, I have to type
