    - Here's another set of operators - assignment operators. They're used to assign
      values to variables. You already know of the "=" operator.
    - But there's other assignment operators that let you do arithmetic and assignment
      at the same time. These operators are "+=", "-=", "*=", and "/=".
    - These operators are basically shorthand.. Imagine I have a variable x with
      a value of 5 and I want to add 10 to it and store the sum in the same variable.

    - 'Right. But here''s a shorter way to do it:

      x += 5;

      In this case,
      x will still equal 15.'
    - 'On the same vein:

      x -= 3 is the same as x = x - 3,

      x *= 3 is
      the same as x = x * 3,

      and x /= 3 is the same as x = x / 3.'
    - For this one, deal's the same as before. Only this time, you have to manipulate
      the given variable with assignment operators to get the password.
