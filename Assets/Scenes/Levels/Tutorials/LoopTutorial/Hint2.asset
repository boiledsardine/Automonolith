    - Okay, yeah, this is a bit more complicated so listen close. First, declare
      a while loop as usual.
    - Next, make sure the condition is something that you can change over time. A
      comparison expression is most common.
    - Something like "varName < 3", where varName's value is subject to change. Once
      varName becomes equal to or greater than 3, the loop stops.
    - Oh right, declare the variable you're using before the while loop. If you declare
      it inside the loop, it'll just be reset to its first value every time the loop
      repeats.
    - 'And keep in mind that programmers start counting from 0. So:

      int varName
      = 0; //declared outside the loop

      while(varName < 3)'
    - After that, use an increment inside the loop so the value of varName goes up
      by 1 every time the loop reaches that line.
    - 'Increments and decrements are made as such respectively:

      varName++;

      varName--;'
    - 'I''ve already given you a framework to work with, just fill it in.

      Whew,
      long explanation.'
