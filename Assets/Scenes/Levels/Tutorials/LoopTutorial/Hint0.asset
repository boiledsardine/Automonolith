    - I already made a barebones declaration of a while loop for you. All you need
      to do is fill it in.
    - Put a condition between the "()". It could be a boolean like true or false,
      or a comparison like "5 < 10", as long as it equates to true or false.
    - Put the code you want to repeat between the curly braces - "{}". Code outside
      the curly braces won't repeat.
