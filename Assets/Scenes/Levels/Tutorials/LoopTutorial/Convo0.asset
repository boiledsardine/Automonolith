      to reach that yellow button and press it multiple times?

    - You'll have to type that same sequence of methods out that many times, and
      that's both inconvenient and makes for messy code.
    - 'Which is where loops come into play. There''s three types of loop, but for
      now we''ll cover while loops as it''s the simplest. The while keyword becomes
      magenta when written right.Follow this syntax:'
    - "~while(boolean value or condition)\r`\n~{\r`\n~  //code to be looped\r`\n~}`"
    - You can put booleans like true or false between the while loop's "()" pair
      or a comparative expression like "5 < 10" - which is true.
    - As long as the condition you put between the () that comes after the "while"
      keyword is true, the code between the {} will repeat.

    - Yep. G4wain will just keep moving right as long as the condition of the loop
      is true. Try it yourself, use a while loop with a true condition to make G4wain
      walk in circles and press that button until I tell you to stop.
    - Oh right, I kinda sorta disabled the pathfinding algorithm for a short while.
      So no ~moveTo()` for now. I'll give it back later, I promise.
