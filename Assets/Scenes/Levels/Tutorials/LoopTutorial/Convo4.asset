    - This corridor's a bit longer, and the button isn't at the end like usual. Instead,
      there's a trap at the end.

    - Yep, it's so you could practice non-infinite loops. The loops you've been using
      up until now are infinite.
    - They'll keep going and going and going without end. They have their niche uses,
      sure, but a loop that never ends isn't very useful most of the time.
    - So it's better to make sure a loop can end by making it so its condition eventually
      becomes false.
    - The best way to make a non-infnite loop is by using a comparative boolean expression
      as a condition. And use variables whose values you can change.
    - Take the condition "5 < 10" - since both of those values aren't variables,
      they can't change, thus the loop is always true.
    - ' But what if the condition was "num < 5", where num is 0 and goes up by 1
      every time the loop hits its end?'

    - Then the num variable will become 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, and then 5. "5
      < 5" is false, so the loop ends.

    - Precisely. Increment and decrement operators come in very handy here. "++"
      increases a variable by 1 while "--" decreases it by 1.
    - 'Simply put "++" or "--" after a variable. That''s a whole expression. Like
      this:

      int x = 10;

      x++; (x is now 11)'

    - 'Yeah, loops aren''t exactly the cakewalk you''ve been having up until now. '
    - Buuut remember what I said about using the help I'm giving you and you should
      be just fine.
    - Now make a non-infinite loop that ends when you reach that button on the floor.
      If you use an infinite loop here, G4wain's gonna step into a trap.
