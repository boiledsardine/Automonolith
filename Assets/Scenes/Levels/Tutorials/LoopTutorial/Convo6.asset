    - Behold, the technology of the Ancients - the green one on the left is an Generator
      and the red one on the right is an Acceptor.
    - The Generator endlessly creates cubes containing energy which can be put in
      an Acceptor to power structures, like gates.
    - Of course, it's dangerous for you to handle it yourself which is why you'll
      make G4wain do it. The cubes can be picked up and dropped.

    - That'll work. But. You see that number above the Acceptor? That's how many
      cubes it needs to be fully powered.

    - Yep. A simple pick-up and drop-off in the right spot. Now get to it.
