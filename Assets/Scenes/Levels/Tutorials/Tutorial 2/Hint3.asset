    - How do you open a door? With a key, of course. Move G4wain next to the key
      with a movement method, then make him turn to face the key. That's his right.
    - Once G4wain is facing the key, use "Bot.hold();" to pick it up, then turn north
      (up) to face the gate. After that just use "Bot.interact();" to open it and
      then move G4wain onto the button.
