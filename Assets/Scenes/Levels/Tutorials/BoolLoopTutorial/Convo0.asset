    - Yep, more data types. This time, we're covering booleans! Booleans store a
      value that is either true or false.
    - Since it stores a true or false value, it acts as an on-or-off switch for things
      that require conditions, like loops which we'll cover later.
    - 'But for now, let''s cover how booleans work. Use the bool type to declare
      a boolean, like so:

      bool myBool = true;'
    - Also, I've made it so now the say() method takes booleans as arguments. For
      this one, declare two booleans and use their values to open the vox gates.
