    - 'And that''s how comparison operators work. Here, a list of comparison operators:

      "=="
      checks if two values are equal.

      "!=" checks if two values are not equal.'
    - '"<" checks if the first value is less than the second.

      ">" checks if
      the first value is greater than the second.'
    - '"<=" checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.

      ">="
      checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.'
    - 'Fun fact: much like how you can assign arithmetic expressions to int variables,
      you can also assign comparison expressions to bool variables!'
    - 'Oh! Take note: you can''t compare two values with different data types. So
      something like 3 == "Three", while it makes sense to us, is actually an error.'

    - Because 3 is an int and "Three" is a string. Thus they cannot be compared.

    - Yeah. Exception though is with numerical types. You can compare ints with floats
      and doubles just fine.
    - G4wain can't do doubles and floats yet though so don't think too much about
      it for now Maybe Merlin has something about it though.
    - Anyway, got them somewhat familiarized? I've prepared more vox gates, the passwords
      are the answers to the questions I put in the editor. Have fun~
