    - 'And that''s how comparison operators work. Here, a list of comparison operators:

      "=="
      checks if two values are equal.

      "!=" checks if two values are not equal.'
    - '"<" checks if the first value is less than the second.

      ">" checks if
      the first value is greater than the second.'
    - '"<=" checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.

      ">="
      checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.'
    - 'Fun fact: much like how you can assign arithmetic expressions to int variables,
      you can also assign comparison expressions to bool variables!'
    - Got them somewhat familiarized? Good. I've prepared more vox gates, the passwords
      are the answers to the questions I put in the editor. Have fun~
