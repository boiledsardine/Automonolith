    - See that panel there? It's storing an int which changes randomly every time
      you execute code, and the stage changes with the panel.
    - Use an if statement to check if the int in the panel is less than 5. If it
      is, go left. If it isn't, go right. Use an else statement for this one.
    - Aaand back to you!
