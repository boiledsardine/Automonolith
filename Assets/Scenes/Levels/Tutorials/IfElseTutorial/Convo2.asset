    - Alright, else statements! Else statements come after if statements and, unlike
      if statements, don't take conditions.
    - 'Instead, their code executes automatically if the condition of the if statement
      before it is false. Like if, else becomes <color=#925bb3>magenta</color> when
      written right. Write one like this after an if statement:'
    - "else\n{\n  //executed if the if statement is false\n}"
    - The else statement only executes if the if statement before it is false. If
      the if statement before it is true, then the else block is skipped.

    - 'Alright, so as an example, I have an if statement and an else statement like
      these:'
    - "if(5 > 10)\r\n{\r\n  Bot.say(\"5 is greater than 10!\");\r\n}"
    - "else\r\n{\r\n  Bot.say(\"5 is not greater than 10!\");\r\n}"
    - Since 5 > 10 is false, the first Bot.say() command is skipped, and so the the
      executed command is the code in the else block...
    - And G4wain says "5 is not greater than 10!". But if the condition was true,
      the first command runs and the second is skipped?

    - Pretty much. Why don't you try? Here, the  path G4wain takes depends on the
      condition you pass.
    - 'Here''s a hint: G4wain has to reach the right side. Try passing a condition
      so that the else block is reached.'
