    - Alright, else statements! Else statements come after if statements and, unlike
      if statements, don't take conditions.
    - 'Instead, their code executes automatically if the condition of the if statement
      before it is false. Like if, else becomes <color=#925bb3>magenta</color> when
      written right. Write one like this after an if statement:'
    - '~else`

      ~{`

      ~  //executed if the if statement is false`

      ~}`'
    - The ~else` statement only executes if the ~if` statement before it is false.
      If the if statement before it is true, then the else block is skipped.

    - 'Alright, so as an example, I have an if statement and an else statement like
      these:'

      ~{

      ~  Bot.say("5 is not greater than 10!");

      ~}'
    - Since 5 > 10 is false, the first ~Bot.say()` command is skipped, and so the
      the executed command is the code in the else block...
    - And G4wain says ~"5 is not greater than 10!"`. But if the condition was true,
      the first command runs and the second is skipped?

    - 'Pretty much. Why don''t you try? Here, the  path G4wain takes depends on the
      condition you pass. Here''s a hint: G4wain has to reach the right side. Try
      passing a condition so that the else block is reached.'
