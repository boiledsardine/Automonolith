    - Right, now that G4wain can make decisions, it's time we tackled conditional
      statements in code.
    - Conditional statements like ~if`, ~else`, and ~else-if` use booleans to execute
      or skip blocks of code depending on whether or not the condition is true.

    - Decision-making is a huge part of programming. There are times when you want
      your code to do one thing or another based on its inputs.
    - The if, else, and else-if statements enable that. We'll tackle those three
      one-by-one, but conceptually, they're similar.
    - 'The if keyword becomes magenta when written right. Write an if statement like
      this:'
    - "~if(condition)\r`\n~{\r`\n~  //code to be executed if condition is true\r`\n~}\r`\nThe
      condition can be a boolean value or a boolean expression."
    - "For if statements, if the condition is true, the code between the curly braces
      runs. If not, the whole block is skipped over.\r"
    - Why don't you try it out? I've written an if statement here without a condition.
      At the end of the code, G4wain will move up. You have to provide the condition
      needed to make G4wain move right first or else he'll walk into a trap. Get
      to it!
