    - Right, now that G4wain can make decisions, it's time we tackled conditional
      statements in code.
    - Conditional statements like if, else, and if-else use booleans to execute or
      skip blocks of code depending on whether or not the condition is true.

    - Decision-making is a huge part of programming. There are times when you want
      your code to do one thing or another based on its inputs.
    - The if, else, and else-if statements enable that. We'll tackle those three
      one-by-one, but conceptually, they're similar.
    - 'Write an if statement like this:'
    - "if(condition)\r\n{\r\n  //code to be executed if condition is true\r\n}\r"
    - 'The condition can be a boolean value or a conditional statement like a comparison. '
    - "For if statements, if the condition is true, the code between the {} runs.
      If not, the whole block is skipped over.\r"
    - Why don't you try it out? I've written an if statement here without a condition.
      At the end of the code, G4wain will move up.
    - You have to provide the condition needed to make G4wain move right first or
      else he'll walk into a trap. Get to it!
