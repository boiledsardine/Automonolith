    - 'Your turn to use else-if statements. I''ve already given you one of them,
      all you have to do is give it the needed condition in the given comment. '
    - After that, write your own else if statement that that checks if num is 3 (use
      a boolean expression) and moves G4wain to "B2" if it's true (with the ~moveTo()`
      method). Add an else statement at the end of the long chain of ifs and elses.
    - "Put this between an if or else if statement but before an else statement:\n~else
      if(condition) {`\n  ~//code to be executed if preceding condition is false`\n~}`"
