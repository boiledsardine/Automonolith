    - '"But Morgan, your most gracious excellency, how is this important to exploring
      the Monolith", you ask?'
    - Well, remember the cube generators? Yeah, those things were faulty. They're
      supposed to create cubes of three colors.

    - So I have to use if-else statements so G4wain can identify the color of the
      cube he's holding and put it in the proper acceptor?

    - Yes, that's what we'll use them for. With the CheckCube() function, G4wain
      can see if his cube is of a certain color.
    - "You can use CheckCube() like a value:\nbool isRed = Bot.CheckCube(\"red\");\r\nor
      as the condition to an if statement:\r\nif(Bot.CheckCube(\"red\")){}\r"
    - CheckCube() takes string arguments that are either "red", "green", or "blue".
      So keeping in mind the examples from before...

    - If the cube G4wain is holding is red, isRed is true and the if statement executes.
      But if it's blue, isRed is false and the if statement is skipped.

    - Yeah. Why don't you try writing your own if/else-if/else statements now? That
      item generator will create a random color cube.
    - So G4wain has to call the shots on the spot. If it's red, turn left and drop.
      If it's blue, turn up and drop. If it's green, turn right and drop.
    - You can do it!
