    - 'You''re making good progress. At last, we reach the third conditional statement:
      else-if statements.'
    - Else if is like a hybrid else and if. It's an else block with an if statement
      attached to it. So, for example, the if statement above it is false...
    - The else if statement will check its own condition and either run or skip its
      code depending on whether or not the condition is true. Write an else if statement
      after an if statement and before an else statement.

      is true\r`\n~}`"

    - Correct. Suppose you have an int variable "num" and you want to find out if
      num is less than 20 or more than 20 but less than 40.

      says "more than 20, less than 40". And if num is 50 neither condition is true
      so, G4wain says "more than 40".'

    - That's right. Here, I've prepared another chain of if-else if- else statements.
      G4wain needs to get to the middle button. Give the if and else if blocks condtions
      so that G4wain reaches tile C2. Hop to it!
