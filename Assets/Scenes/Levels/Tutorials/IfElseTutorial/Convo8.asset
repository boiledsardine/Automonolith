    - 'Panel with an int that changes every time you hit that shiny green play button.
      This time, it has 4 possible values: 1, 2, 3, and 4.'
    - Use an if-else if-else chain to check which value the panel's currently storing!
    - If it's 1, go to D0. If it's 2, go to C1. If it's 3, go to B2. And if it's
      4, go to A3.
    - Get on it and good luck!
