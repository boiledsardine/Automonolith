    - Yes, but no. See, you can also put if/else if/else statements inside while
      loops. It's called nesting.
    - I realize I didn't mention this before, but you can also nest loops within
      loops and if/else within another if/else. But ignore that for now.
    - Anyway. These acceptors each need a cube of its color. So you'll have to make
      a loop with an if/else statement that sorts cubes.

    - So the same code from before, only this time nested in a while loop that runs
      3 times.

    - Yeah. Good luck. If you need help, remember - hints and the encyclopedia.
