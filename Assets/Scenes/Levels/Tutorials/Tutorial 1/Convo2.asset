    - Now that you've got the hang of camera controls, let's move on to what else
      is in your display.
    - Look at the upper right, two new buttons showed up. The "!" button is the Hints
      button. Use it when you're stuck with a puzzle and I might be able to help
      you out.
    - The question mark button is the Help button. Clicking it opens an encyclopedia
      - written by moi, you're welcome. Reference it if you need help with writing
      code.
    - 'In case you''re wondering, that last button is the menu button. But I suppose
      you didn''t need me to tell you that. '
    - I've also opened time controls. In the lower right, you'll see three buttons.
      Each of those adjusts the speed of the game by 1x, 2x, and 3x respectively.
      You don't have to click them to finish this objective, though.
    - Anyway, click the Hints and Help button once each and we'll get on to the next
      topic.
