    - Now that you've got the hang of camera controls, let's move on to what else
      is in your display.
    - Look at the upper right, two new buttons showed up.
    - The lightbulb button is the Hints button. Use it when you're stuck with a puzzle
      and I might be able to help you out.
    - The question mark button is the Help button. Clicking it opens an encyclopedia
      - written by moi, you're welcome. Reference it if you need help with writing
      code.
    - In case you're wondering, that last button is the menu button. But I suppose
      you didn't need me to tell you that.
    - Anyway, click the Hints and Help button once each and we'll get on to the next
      topic.
