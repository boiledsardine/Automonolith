    - This is the code editor. While it's open, you can type in anything you want
      but remember that G4wain can only understand certain things.
    - To that end, there's a list of methods you could use on the bottom of the code
      editor. If you bring your mouse over one of the methods, it'll show a tooltip
      about that method.
    - The tooltip contains what values the method requires, an example, and its description.
    - Anyway, even if you've written down some code, G4wain won't do anything until
      you tell him to start. To do that, click the green play button in the lower
      right corner of the screen.
    - Take note - once G4wain starts moving, he won't take any new commands that
      you type into the editor so you have to think several steps ahead to guide
      G4wain's steps correctly.
    - Your goal is to get G4wain close to the exit totem (it's that floating slab
      thing with the green arrow) and tell him to touch it.
    - Sometimes you'll have to do some other things first, but for now, just get
      G4wain to touch the exit totem.
    - For now, type "Bot.moveRight();", "Bot.moveDown();", and "Bot.interact();"
      on separate lines and hit the play button. Nothing else in the editor but that,
      capisce?
