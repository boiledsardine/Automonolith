    - 'Okay, looks like that blue panel is storing some tile coordinates. Get its
      value with ~Bot.read(`) and store it in a string variable. Remember:

      ~string
      varName = value;`'
    - 'After that, the vox gate''s password seems to be the sum of the two green
      panels. Get their values with ~Bot.readInt()` and store each one in a separate
      variable. Then use operators to add the variables and say the password in front
      of the vox gate. '
    - 'Here''s a tip that might save you a line: you can perform operations inside
      a method''s argument. Like this:

      ~Bot.say(3 + 5); //will make G4wain
      say 8.`'
    - Then just move to the coordinates you got from the blue panel and push the
      corresponding button with ~Bot.interact()`. One of them ought to power that
      exit totem...
