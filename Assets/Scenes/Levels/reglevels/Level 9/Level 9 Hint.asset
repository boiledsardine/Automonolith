    - 'You''ve already been given an array. All you have to do now is call its elements.
      To do that, use the name of the variable and add "[]" after it. Then put a
      whole number between the "[]". Calling an array element looks like this: varName[0].'
    - Remember that arrays indices start from 0, so if you want the first element,
      use 0 as an index. If you want the third element, use 2 as an index.
    - 'I''ll give you the first one for free:


      ~Bot.say(arr[2]);`'
