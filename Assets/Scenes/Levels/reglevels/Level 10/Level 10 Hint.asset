    - Still remember how to do a while loop? You'll have to do a finite one here
      and loop through the entire array given to you in the first line of code.
    - To get the amount of elements in an array, use the array's name followed by
      ".Length". It'll give you an int value which you can store in a variable or
      use immediately.
    - 'Here, I''ll help you out:


      int num = 0;

      while(num < arrayName.Length)'
    - Don't forget to increment the loop counter inside the looped code block or
      else it'll run forever and the same index will be called indefinitely.
