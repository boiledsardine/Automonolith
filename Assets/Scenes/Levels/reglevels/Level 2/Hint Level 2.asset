    - This should be straightforward. First, use ~Bot.moveRight()` to move near the
      stone pillar. Then use ~Bot.hold()` to grab it.
    - Once that's done, move G4wain so that he drags the pillar to the button there.
      Left, then down. After that, release the block and move to the exit.
    - You could use arguments with your methods so you don't write the same command
      over and over. ~Bot.moveRight(2)` will make G4wain move right twice. Just apply
      that logic to G4wain's movement and you're good to go.
