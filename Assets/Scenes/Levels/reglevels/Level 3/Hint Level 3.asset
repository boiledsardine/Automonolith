    - 'Looks like that green panel randomizes. First, read its value and store it
      in a variable using ~Bot.readInt()`. Remember, for ints:

      ~int varName
      = value;`'
    - Then grab the pillar and move up a number of times based on your variable's
      value. You can use a variable's value by calling its name in code!
    - After that, use ~Bot.moveTo()` to move to tile D0 and get the value of the
      blue panel and store it in a string variable. Use the ~Bot.read()` method.
    - Then just move to tile D3 and use ~Bot.say()` to speak the password from the
      blue panel! After that, you're good to go.
