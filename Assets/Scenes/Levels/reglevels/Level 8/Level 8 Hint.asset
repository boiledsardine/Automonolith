    - Use a finite while loop to fill the acceptor and open the mech gate. Remember,
      you have to use a value that changes over time like a variable.
    - The condition of the while loop will be a comparison of that variable and the
      number of repetitions you want the while loop to do.
    - 'Remember that the value of the variable should be adjusted at the end of the
      loop. Here, I''ll help you out with a step-by-step list:'
    - '1. Create an int variable with a value of 0

      2. Create a while loop
      with a condition that checks if the variable is less than the number above
      the acceptor'
    - 3. Increment the variable by 1 at the end of the looped code block
