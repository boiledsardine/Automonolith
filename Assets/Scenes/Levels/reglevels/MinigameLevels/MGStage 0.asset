      huge gaps. Your task, dear Arthur, is to drag those pieces back to where they
      belong then press Submit() once done.

      exactly what should belong in what slot. Now, let's start with something simple.
    - Ah, brewing coffee. A simple thing to do, and yet, I cannot remember how exactly
      to do it. I really am senile. Help me put together how to make a cup of coffee
      step by step.
