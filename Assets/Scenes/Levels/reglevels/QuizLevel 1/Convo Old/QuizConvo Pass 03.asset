    - With your permission, I'd like to establish a permanent research station in
      the Monolith. There is plenty the Imperial Academy can learn from the Akashic
      relics stored here and it would be a waste to let them gather dust, away from
      the world.

    - In addition, when the time comes that we relearn the secrets of the Akasha,
      we can reactivate the Monolith's dormant systems and take it back to the state
      it was when it was first built.
    - In studying the artifacts here and the guidance Morgan has given me, I've formulated
      a working plan for it moving forward.
    - It must also be tiring to be the Overseer of a monument to a dead civilization.
      With this, we can think about tourism in the future and have this place as
      lively as it was in the past.

    - A while now, actually. But after hearing more about the history of this place
      from you and Nimue, I figured it might be better in the long run to study this
