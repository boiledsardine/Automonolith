  articleText: '~Bot` has a set of methods it could perform to navigate the Monolith.
    The ~Bot` class and its methods (~moveUp`, ~moveDown()`, etc.) are unique to
    this game! You won''t be using them in real code.


    G4wain has the ~moveUp`,
    ~moveDown`, ~moveLeft`, and ~moveRight` methods which you''ll use to instruct
    G4wain to move in a certain direction. To call a method, use that method''s name
    and add "~()"` at the end.


    You can check out what other methods G4wain
    can use in the methods panel in the bottom half of the editor.'
  articleExample: '~Bot.moveRight(); //G4wain moves east`

    ~Bot.moveDown(); //G4wain
    moves south`

    ~Bot.turnRight(); //G4wain turns to face east`

    ~Bot.hold();
    //G4wain holds an object`

    ~Bot.drop(); //G4wain stops holding a held object`'
