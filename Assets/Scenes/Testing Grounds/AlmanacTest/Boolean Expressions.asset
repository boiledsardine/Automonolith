  articleText: 'Boolean expressions can also be assigned to bool variables. It compares
    two values or variables and returns either true or false based on the result
    of the comparison. It is used for conditional testing, especially for loops and
    if-else statements. Boolean expressions use comparison or logical operators.
    Here is a list of comparison operators:

    

    "~==`": Equal to - is true
    when two values are the same.

    "~!=`": Not equal - is true when two values
    are different.

    "~>`": Greater than - is true when the left side is greater
    than the right side.

    "~<`": Less than - is true when the left side is less
    than the right side.

    "~>=`": Greater than or equal to - is true when the
    left side is greater than or equal to the right

    side.

    "~<=`": Less
    than or equal to - is true when the left side is less than or equal to the right
    side.'
  articleExample: '~int x = 10;`

    ~int y = 5;`


    ~bool isEqual = x == y;
    //false`

    ~bool notEqual = x != y; //true`

    ~bool xIsGreater = x > y;
    //true`

    ~bool xIsLesser = x < y; // false`

    ~bool xIsGreaterOrEqual
    = x <= y; //true`

    ~bool xIsGreaterOrLesser = x >= y; //false`'
