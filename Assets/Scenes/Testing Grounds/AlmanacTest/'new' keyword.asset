  articleText: 'The easiest way to create an array is by simply just assigning its
    value at the same time you declare it. This is useful if you want to change the
    entire array in one go, but this game won''t make you do that. This is here for
    sake of explanation.


    You can declare an array without assigning its variable,
    like any other variable.


    ~int[] numbers;`


    The array ~numbers` is
    unassigned. To use it, it must be assigned an array value, but you must use the
    ''~new`'' keyword. The ''~new`'' keyword should be followed by the array''s data
    type and square braces with the size of the array between the square braces.


    This
    kind of assignment will create an array with the given size (in this case, 3)
    but all its elements are empty or 0. To use the ''~new`'' keyword to create an
    array with values, check example 2.


    Notice how you don''t need to specify
    the size of the array between the square braces when you''re doing it this way.
    You still could, but then you''ll need to provide an array literal with the same
    size as the one you specified. Check example 3.'
  articleExample: '~//example 1`

    ~//creates an array with 3 empty elements`

    ~numbers
    = new int[3];`


    ~//this is an error`

    ~//there needs to be a number
    between the []`

    ~numbers = new int[];`


    ~//example 2`

    ~//creates
    an array with {1,2,3} and assigns it to numbers`

    ~numbers = new int[] {1,2,3};`


    ~//example
    3`

    ~//creates an array with size 3 and assigns {1,2,3} to numbers`

    ~numbers
    = new int[3] {1,2,3};`'
