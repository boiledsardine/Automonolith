  articleText: 'Guide G4wain by writing a short program with code.

    

    Each
    instruction must be written on its own line, and each line must be closed with
    a semicolon. The semicolon indicates the end of a line and instructs G4wain to
    read the instructions in the next line.


    To make G4wain do things, such
    as move, you have to use methods. Methods are blocks of code that perform certain
    actions. To use methods, you must first specify from where those methods are
    coming from. To access the methods G4wain knows, refer to it with "Bot.".


    After
    writing "~Bot.`", you can use the methods G4wain has access to, such as movement
    methods.'
  articleExample: '//text in olive green is a comment

    //comments are not read
    as instructions


    ~Bot.moveUp(); //G4wain moves up`

    ~Bot.moveRight();
    //G4wain moves right`

    ~Bot.moveDown(); //G4wain moves down`

    ~Bot.moveLeft();
    //G4wain moves left`


    ~Bot.hold(); //G4wain holds an object`

    ~Bot.drop();
    //G4wain stops holding a held object`'
