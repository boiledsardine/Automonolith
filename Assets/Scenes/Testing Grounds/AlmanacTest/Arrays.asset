  articleText: 'Arrays are data structures that store multiple values in a single
    variable, instead of using separate variables for each value, called elements.
    To declare an array, define the variable''s type with square brackets. For example,
    to declare an array of strings:

    

    ~string[] stringArray;`

    

    This
    array doesn''t store any elements yet. To do so, assign it an array literal,
    which is a list of values separated by commas inside curly braces followed by
    a semicolon.

    

    ~string[] cakes = {"chocolate", "red velvet", "confetti"};`

    

    To
    get the elements of an array, it must be called with its index, a number unique
    to each element of an array. The first element of an array is index 0, the second
    element is index 1, so on. To use an array index, call the array''s name followed
    by square brackets (~[]`) with the index number inside them.'
  articleExample: '~string[] cakes = {"chocolate", "red velvet", "confetti"}; //creates
    an array named cakes with "chocolate", "red velvet", and "confetti" as its elements`


    ~Bot.say(cakes[0]);
    //G4wain says "chocolate"`

    ~Bot.say(cakes[1]); //G4wain says "red velvet"`

    ~Bot.say(cakes[2]);
    //G4wain says "confetti"`

    ~Bot.say(cakes[3]); //error: cakes[3] is looking
    for a 4th element in an array with 3 elements`'
