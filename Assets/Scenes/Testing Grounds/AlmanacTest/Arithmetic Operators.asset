  articleName: Arithmetic operators
  articleText: "In performing an operation we used operators on variables and values.
    Operations follow the PEMDAS rule, evaluating expressions in parentheses first,
    then performing, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. The arithmetic
    operators are: \r\n\r\n\"~+`\" (addition), \"~-`\" (subtraction), \"~*`\" (multiplication),\r\n\"~/`\"
    (division), \"~++`\" (increment), \"~--`\" (decrement)\r\n\r\nThe increment (~++`)
    and decrement (~--`) operators are used to operate on variables by increasing
    or decreasing their value by one."
  articleExample: '~int sum = 100 + 200; //300`

    ~int difference = 350 - 150;
    //200`

    ~int product = sum * 2; //600 (300 * 2)`

    ~int quotient = difference
    / 2; //100 (200 / 2)`



    ~int x = 10;`

    ~x++; //x is now 11 (10 + 1)`

    ~x--;
    //x is now 10 (11 - 1)`'
