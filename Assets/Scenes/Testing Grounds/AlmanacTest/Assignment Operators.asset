  articleName: Assignment Operators
  articleText: "Assignment operators are operators used to assign values to variables.
    One such operator you've already seen is the assignment operator represented
    by an equals sign (=). The assignment operator can be combined with arithmetic
    operators to perform an operation involving the variable's value and the given
    value, shorthand for a longer expression. Here's a list of assignment operators:\r\n\r\n\"~+=`\":
    \"~x += 5`\" is the same as \u201C~x = x + 5`\"\r\n\"~-=`\": \"~x -= 5`\" is
    the same as \u201C~x = x - 5`\"\r\n\"~*=`\": \"~x *= 5`\" is the same as \u201C~x
    = x * 5`\"\r\n\"~/=`\": \"~x /= 5`\" is the same as \"~x = x / 5`\""
  articleExample: '~int x = 10;`

    ~x += 5; //x is now 15 (x = x + 5)`

    ~x
    -= 10; //x is now 5 (x = x - 10)`

    ~x *= 4; //x is now 20 (x = x * 4)`

    ~x
    /= 2; //x is now 10 (x = x / 2)`'
