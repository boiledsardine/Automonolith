  articleName: While Loops 2
  articleText: To create a non-infinite loop, it's better to pass a boolean expression
    as the while loop's condition instead of a constant true/false value. The boolean
    expression must be able to change over time, meaning that it should use variables
    which can be changed by the code within the loop itself. It's common to use a
    variable that acts as a counter, and an increment or decrement statement within
    the loop to change its value.
  articleExample: "~int num = 0; //this variable is a counter`\r\n~while (num < 3)
    //loop runs as long as num is less than 3`\r\n~{`\r\n ~Bot.say(num); //makes
    G4wain say the current value of num.`\r\n  ~num++; //adds 1 to the value of num
    every time the loop completes. This is important!`\r\n~}`\r\n\r\nEvery time the
    loop runs, ~num` is increased by 1.\r\nAafter the first loop, ~num` becomes 1.\r\nAfter
    the second loop, ~num` becomes 2.\r\nAfter the third loop, ~num` becomes 3.\r\nThe
    fourth loop does not run becuase ~3 < 3` is false."
