  articleName: While Loops 1
  articleText: "Loops execute a block of code as long as the condition given is true.
    There are three types of loop: while, do/while, and for, but this game will cover
    while loops only as it is the simplest of the three. Curly braces mark the lines
    of code to be repeated. This is the syntax for a while loop:\r\n\r\n~while(condition)`\r\n~{`\r\n 
    ~//code to be repeated`\r\n~}`\r\n\r\nWhere ~condition` is a bool like ~true`
    or ~false` or a boolean expression like ~5 < 10`."
  articleExample: "~while(5 < 10)\r`\n~{\r`\n~  Bot.say(\"Hello!\"); //G4wain says
    hello over and over as long as the condition is true\r`\n~}\r`\n\nSince the condition
    is always true, this loop will run infinitely."
