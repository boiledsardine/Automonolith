  articleText: 'You can change the values of an array''s elements after creation,
    much like how you can changem the values of a variable! Simply call the array''s
    name followed by the index of the element you want to change and assign a new
    value. For example, we have an array of prime numbers:


    ~int[] primes =
    {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};`


    We want to change ~9` (not prime) to ~11` (prime). Simply
    call the index of ~9` and assign a new value:


    ~primes[4] = 11; //changes
    the element at index 4 (9) to 11`'
  articleExample: '~string[] dogs = {"pug", "poodle", "goldfish", "samoyed", "sphinx"};
    //"goldfish" and "sphinx" are not dogs!`


    ~dogs[2] = "husky"; //changes
    "goldfish" to "husky"`

    ~dogs[4] = "labrador"; //changes "sphinx" to "labrador"`'
